#MERLot: A MEthod for Reconstructing Lineage tree Topologies using scRNA seq data

MERLot is a tool that can reconstruct the lineage tree topology that explains the emergence of different cell types from a progenitor population. MERLot is an R package than can reconstruct complex lineage tree topologies using coordinates for cells in a given manifold(like diffusion maps) as input.
